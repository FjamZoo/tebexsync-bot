# TebexSync-Discord-Bot

TebexSync-Discord-Bot seamlessly integrates with your Tebex store to automatically grant buyers channel access and features a flexible ticket system with dynamic fields for efficient and organized support.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is **not affiliated** in any way with Tebex Limited.
> It is a third party application provided and maintained by Maximus7474 to help organizations selling on tebex to grant customer roles on their discord server and provide systems to simplify purchase verification and providing support.

## Features

### Ticket System Features:
* Customizable Ticket Categories: Create multiple ticket categories, each with different prerequisites.
* Transaction ID Verification: Tickets can be configured to require a valid transaction ID from your Tebex store.
* Dynamic Forms: A modal form displays fields linked to the ticket category, with options for required inputs and minimum/maximum length.
* Support Workflow: Users can add others to a ticket, and the system includes a closure feature with an optional reason.

### Customer Role Management
* Automatic Role Assignment: Customers who make a purchase with a linked Discord account will automatically receive their roles.
* Manual Claiming: Users without a linked account can claim their roles by using a command with their transaction ID.
* Developer Access: Customers can grant access to a configurable number of developers.
* Purchase Status Sync: Roles are automatically removed if a purchase is refunded, chargebacked, or canceled. These roles cannot be claimed again.

---

## üì¶ Setup

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env
   ```

2. Replace the following values in the `.env` file:
   - `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`: Your bot's authentication token from Discord's developer portal.
   - `MAIN_GUILD_ID`: The Discord ID of your main guild.

---

## üöÄ Deploying

- The TypeScript code is built using `tsc`.  
- The `scripts/build.js` file also transfers the `base.sql` files from the `database` folder to ensure smooth operation.

**Note:**  
Building the project does not deploy the slash commands to Discord's API. You must run the `deploy` script to do so.

### Deployment Steps:
1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   pnpm run build
   ```
2. Deploy the slash commands:
   ```bash
   pnpm run deploy
   ```

**Important:**  
The deploy script reads command data from the `dist/` directory. Ensure you run the build script before deploying.

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Management

- The bot currently supports multiple database systems but is configured to run with `sqlite` by default.
- Contributions for integrating other database systems (e.g., MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) are welcome.  
  However, the project aims to avoid adding unused dependencies.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning: DO NOT MAKE THE `.env` FILE PUBLIC

By default, the `.env` file is ignored by Git (via `.gitignore`).  
If you disable this, it can lead to severe security risks, such as:

- Hackers gaining access to your authentication token and using it maliciously.
- Other unintended consequences.

**To stay safe:**
- Do not remove `.env` from the `.gitignore` file.
- Ensure your `.env` file remains private.
